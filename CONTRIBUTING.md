# Contributing to Acode

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Acode! This guide will help you get started with development.

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: DevContainer (Recommended)

1. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VS Code or other editors that support [DevContainers](https://containers.dev/).

2. Clone and open the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode.git
   code Acode
   ```

3. When VS Code prompts "Reopen in Container", click it
   - Or use Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

4. Wait for the container to build (~5-10 minutes first time, subsequent opens are instant)

5. Once ready, build the APK:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build paid dev apk
   ```

   > Use any package manager (pnpm, bun, npm, yarn, etc.)

### Option 2: Docker CLI (For Any Editor)

> [!NOTE]
> If you try to use Podman, Kindly note that it would not work properly until https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5845 is merged/implemented in Podman.

If your editor doesn't support DevContainers, you can use Docker directly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode.git
cd Acode

# Build the Docker image from our Dockerfile
docker build --target standalone -t acode-dev .devcontainer/

# Run the container with your code mounted
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspaces/acode" \
  -w /workspaces/acode \
  acode-dev \
  bash

# Inside the container, run setup and build
# bun run setup && bun run build paid dev apk
pnpm run setup
pnpm run build paid dev apk # or pnpm run build p d
```

**Keep container running for repeated use:**
```bash
# Start container in background
docker run -d --name acode-dev \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspaces/acode" \
  -w /workspaces/acode \
  acode-dev \
  sleep infinity

# Execute commands in the running container
docker exec -it acode-dev bash -c "pnpm run setup"
docker exec -it acode-dev pnpm run build paid dev apk

# Stop and remove when done
docker stop acode-dev && docker rm acode-dev
```

## 🛠️ Manual Setup (Without Docker)

If you prefer not to use Docker at all:

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|------------|---------|
| **Node.js** | 18+ (22 recommended) |
| **pnpm** or **bun** | Latest |
| **Java JDK** | 17+ (21 recommended) |
| **Android SDK** | API 35 | 
| **Gradle** | 8.x |

### Environment Setup

Add these to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish`):

**macOS:**
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin"
```

**Linux:**
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk"
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin"
```

Some more environment variables, check [cordova docs](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html).

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode.git
cd Acode

# Install dependencies and set up Cordova
pnpm run setup

# Build the APK
pnpm run build paid dev apk # or pnpm run build p d
```

The APK will be at: `platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

> [!NOTE]
> `@codemirror/lsp-client` comes from the `codemirror-lsp-client` git submodule and is installed as a local `file:` dependency, so the submodule must be cloned before `setup` runs. If it isn't, `setup` stops with a missing-submodules error — see [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### `setup` fails: submodules are not checked out

`@codemirror/lsp-client` is not fetched from a registry. It comes from the
[`codemirror-lsp-client`](https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/codemirror-lsp-client)
git submodule and is installed as a local `file:` dependency.

Before installing dependencies, `pnpm run setup` reads `.gitmodules` and verifies that
every submodule it declares has actually been cloned — a directory only counts as cloned
when it contains at least one non-hidden file. An empty, missing, or partial checkout (for
example one holding only `.git` or `node_modules`) therefore stops setup with:

```
The following submodule(s) are not checked out (empty or absent):
```

To fix it, initialize the submodules from the repository root and re-run setup:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
pnpm run setup
```

This usually means the repository was cloned without `--recurse-submodules`. Cloning with
submodules avoids the problem entirely:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode.git
```

> [!NOTE]
> The check is skipped when `.gitmodules` is absent (for example an unpacked source
> archive) or declares no submodules, so those setups are unaffected.

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Before Submitting a PR

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. **Make changes** - keep commits focused and atomic
3. **Check code quality:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run check
   ```
4. **Test** on a device or emulator if possible

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Clear description of changes
- [ ] Reference to related issue (if applicable)
- [ ] Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
- [ ] Passing CI checks

### Code Style

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting:
- Run `pnpm run check` before committing
- Install the Biome VS Code extension for auto-formatting

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive messages:
```
feat: add dark mode toggle to settings
fix: resolve crash when opening large files
docs: update build instructions
refactor: simplify file loading logic
```

## 🌍 Adding Translations

1. Create a JSON file in `src/lang/` (e.g., `fr-fr.json` for French)
2. Add it to `src/lib/lang.js`
3. Use the translation utilities:
   ```bash
   pnpm run lang add       # Add new string
   pnpm run lang remove    # Remove string
   pnpm run lang search    # Search strings
   pnpm run lang update    # Update translations
   ```

## ℹ️ Adding New Icons (to the existing font family)
> [!NOTE]
> Acode uses SVG and converts them into a font family, to be used inside the editor and generally for plugin devs.
> 
> **Plugin-specific icons SHOULD NOT be added into the editor. Only generally helpful icons SHOULD BE added**

Many font editing software and web-based tools exist for this purpose. Some of them are listed below.

| Name | Platform |
|------|----------|
| https://icomoon.io/ | Free (Web-Based, PWA-supported, Offline-supported) |
| https://fontforge.org/ | Open-Source (Linux, Mac, Windows) |

### Steps in Icomoon to add new Icons

1. Download the `code-editor-icon.icomoon.json` file from https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode/tree/main/utils
2. Go to https://icomoon.io/ > Import
3. Import the `code-editor-icon.icomoon.json` downloaded (in step 1)
4. All icons will be displayed after importing.
5. Import the SVG icon created/downloaded to be added to the Font Family.
6. On the right side, press **enable Show Characters** & **Show Names** to view the Unicode character & Name for that icon.
7. Provided the newly added SVG icon with a name (in the name box).
8. Repeat Step 5 and Step 7 until all needed new icons are added.
9. Press the export icon from the top left-hand side.
10. Press the download button, and a zip file will be downloaded.
11. Go to the Projects section of [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/new-app), uncollapse/expand the Project named `code-editor-icon`  and press the **save** button (this downloads the project file named: `code-editor-icon.icomoon.json`)

### Updating Project files for Icon Contribution
1. Extract the downloaded zip file; navigate to the `fonts` folder inside it.
2. Rename `code-editor-icon.ttf` to `icons.ttf`.
3. Copy & paste the renamed `icons.ttf` into https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode/tree/main/src/res/icons
4. Copy and paste the `code-editor-icon.icomoon.json` file (downloaded in the adding icons steps) onto https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode/tree/main/utils (yes, replace it with the newer one; we downloaded!)
4. Commit the changes **ON A NEW branch** (by following: [Commit Messages guide](#commit-messages))
